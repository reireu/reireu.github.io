          Hi! I'm <strong>Serena Kurashina!</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            I was born in 2005 and graduated in 2027.<br>
            I lived in a country in Kenya for 3 years and Botswana for 2 years due to my father's work. <br>
            He is working in JICA, which is a kind of Japanese government organization. <br>
            I have been studying English, French, and Chinese. <br>
            I am currently working on improving my English skills. <br>
            I am also interested in learning about the culture of the country where I lived. <br>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
            <h5 class="card-title" id="life">my life</h5>
          I went to Kenya for the first time when I was 2 years old. <br>
          I don't remember much about it, but I have some memories of it. <br>
          I learned ballet and riding horses there. <br>
          I really love the atmosphere at there <br>

          I went back to Japan when I was 5 years old. <br>
          I went to kindergarten and primary school in Japan. <br>
          It was a little difficult for me to get used to the Japanese school system. <br>
          But I really enjoyed my life in Japan. <br>

          I went to Botswana when I was 10 years old. <br>
          In Japan, I didn't much have difficulties for English learning,but whenI went there, I couldn't understand word 'understand' and thought they're asking either I want to stand so I really tried hard to learn English<br>
